## Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various features related to wine composition and quality. The primary goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a wine is of good quality or not based on its characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

## ML Algorithm
We have employed a machine learning algorithm to classify wines into two categories: good quality and not good quality. The algorithm is implemented using Python and the Scikit-learn library.
